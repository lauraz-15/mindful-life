# Design 

The colour pallete is chosen to work with the midfulness theme - neutural and calm, to ensure that design works with the main subject of the website. The colours work together and repeat across the site to ensure consistency and continuity.

## Color Palette

Color palette was originally generated from [Colorhunt.co](https://colorhunt.co/palette/93b5c6c9ccd5e4d8dcffe3e3)

![Hex code color palette](https://github.com/lauraz-15/mindful-life/blob/main/assets/readme_images/color-palette-hex.png)

However, later on was adjusted slighty to meet the accessability standards.

![Actual Color Palette](https://github.com/lauraz-15/mindful-life/blob/main/assets/readme_images/actual-color-palette.png)

### Bugs

- Initially had an issue with mobile devise responsivness - the sizing of the video caused nav bar to strectch. Issue was fixed re-sizing and positioning videos using css styles.

- Background images for events section didn't load on deployed webisite, but were loading on local server. Issue was fixed changing file path to relative instead of absolute.

- Some parts of top page content were hidden behing the nav bar, iniitially issue was fixed using margin-top property, however better solution was found later on - the diplay property for the nav-bar was changed from 'fixed' to 'sticky',that solved the issue.

- Techniques page section menu was not 'stuck'to the top of the page. A lot of CSS properties were tested and content changed for techniques page. The issue was easily fixed by moving the menu into header section and adding few style properties, that insured the desired outcome. 

### Unfixed bugs

- The section menu can't be styled on mobile devices, it takes too much space. ideally would require burger menu, but for that javascript cosing would be required. For that reaon this menu is hidden on mobile devises, however that doesn;t affect the content of the page.
