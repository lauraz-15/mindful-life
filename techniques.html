        <h2>Meditation</h2>
        <p>
            Meditation is like a daily massage for your mind. In a practical sense, it helps you gain distance from your
            thoughts and emotions like a 3rd party watching your thoughts in emotions as they pass by. Gaining this
            distance can be the difference between taking a dip in your anxiety and quickly recovering versus drowning
            in a sea of emotional reactions. Mindfulness becomes your sanity preserver, so to speak.

            While people’s experience with mediation varies wildly, there does seem to be strong supporting evidence
            showing the reduction of depression, and anxiety. While we have yet to see a conclusive study, the fact that
            mediation has been practiced for centuries as a means to better one’s life, provides enough ‘real-life’
            evidence for its utility.
            On its surface, meditation looks intimidating because there are so many different styles: Transcendental
            Meditation (TM), Guided Visualization, Zazen, Qigong and many others.
            For the first few weeks, perhaps even months, meditation can appear as though it has no noticeable effect on
            your life. Unlike adopting a new diet and workout plan, you will not visibly see your mediation 6-pack so
            fast. It’s subtler than that and will probably take more time.

        <h2>The 5 Minute journal</h2>
        <p>
            At its core, The Five Minute Journal is about gratitude. Based loosely off of positive psychology research,
            it was designed as a simple, effective, and efficient means to focus on the good, set intention for the day,
            and reflect.

            The journal contains 5 questions broken up into two sections: A morning section to be filled out after you
            get up and a night section to be filled out right before bed. Doing this first thing in the morning primes
            your day to positive thoughts while the evening section helps you end your day on a high-note, helping you
            fall asleep much more easily!
        </p>
        <h3>In the morning:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>What are you grateful for?</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p>What would make today great?</p> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Daily affirmation. I am…</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>In the evening:</h3>
        <ol>

               <p>3 Amazing things that happened today…</p> 
            </li>

        <h2> Morning pages</h2>
        <p>
            Introduced in the Artist’s Way by Julia Cameron, morning pages are three stream of consciousness pages
            written after you wake up where you keep moving your pen no matter what. No censoring, crossing out, or
            editing. It does not matter that your writing makes sense.

            The purpose? Trap your problems onto paper so you can move on with your day.

            These pages are not meant to be read. In fact, Cameron advises that you yourself shouldn’t even read the
            pages in the first few months. The goal is not to aim at “something.” You are merely doing a brain purge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tim Ferriss: On his blog, Tim wrote: “Morning pages don’t need to solve your problems. They simply need to
            get them out of your head, where they’ll otherwise bounce around all day like a bullet ricocheting inside
            your skull.Could bitching and moaning on paper for five minutes each morning change your life? As crazy as
            it might seem, I believe the answer is yes."

        <h2>Mindful eating</h2>
        <p>
            Mindful eating is a technique that helps you gain control over your eating habits.
            It has been shown to promote weight loss, reduce binge eating, and help you feel better.
            Mindful eating is about using mindfulness to reach a state of full attention to your experiences, cravings,
            and physical cues when eating (8).
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Eating slowly and without distractions</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Listening to physical hunger cues and eating only until you’re full</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Distinguishing between true hunger and non-hunger triggers for eating</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Engaging your senses by noticing colors, smells, sounds, textures, and flavors</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Learning to cope with guilt and anxiety about food</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Eating to maintain overall health and well-being</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Noticing the effects food has on your feelings and figure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Appreciating your food</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            By eating mindfully, you restore your attention and slow down, making eating an intentional act instead of
            an automatic one.

            What’s more, by increasing your recognition of physical hunger and fullness cues, you are able to
            distinguish between emotional and true, physical hunger (10Trusted Source).

            You also increase your awareness of triggers that make you want to eat, even though you’re not necessarily
            hungry.

            By knowing your triggers, you can create a space between them and your response, giving you the time and
            freedom to choose how to react.

        <h2>Long Walks</h2>
        <p>
            In short, taking a long walk with no other purpose than to wander.

            How often do you walk for its own sake without intention to be someplace?

            In a similar vein to how many report ideas coming to them in the shower, long walks work a similar magic.

            Could it be due to the mental break from our busy lives? Could it be that once our bodies are in motion, it
            cues our creative faculties to take over? Perhaps. But what we do know, is it works for clearing your mind.
        </p>
        <h3>Here are some ground rules</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Walk for at least 15 minutes (the longer, the better)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Walk with no fixed route</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Preferably leave your phone at home or set it to airplane mode.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Don’t listen to music or podcasts</p>
            </li>
            <li>
               <p> Go alone</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Find walkable places (busy city streets may cause too much “noise”)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Stop to notice your surroundings.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <img src="assets/images/walking-alone.jpg" alt="Photo with a woman going for a walk alone">
        <p>
            As someone who has been taking long walks for over a decade, the hardest part is communicating to your loved
            ones you are just going for a walk. They will ask where to? To which I say “to clear my head or think of how
            to solve a problem”. In the beginning, it may arouse suspicions as if something is wrong in the relationship
            but through reassurance, my loved ones know I just like taking long walks.

        <h3>Mindful running</h3>
        <p>
            If your intention is to run mindfully, you want to shed any anchor points (your GPS watch, your phone, your
            music) that might distract you. It doesn’t necessarily have to be for the entire run; “even five minutes can
            teach you something,” says Puddicombe.

            Once you’ve shed those external distractions, stay present by focusing on two important questions: “How am I
            breathing?” and “Where am I looking?” It’s not about maintaining a certain breathing pattern, rather
            decoding your breath to determine where you’re at. Breathing too fast? Slow down. Feel like you could hold a
            conversation easily? Maybe speed up a bit. Try to breathe through your nose as much as you can.
            Mouth-breathing is a stress response, so focusing on nostril breathing keeps you in a more relaxed state.
            And keep your gaze soft and wide, toward your periphery, instead of focused, to stay in that chill zone,
            Oxley says.

            You’ll start to notice more the more you stay in that zone, adds Puddicombe. “You definitely take in more
            around you; you notice more about your posture; you notice more about your technique; and you learn about
            your body,” he says. “And if we’re not learning, then we’ve learned something wrong.”
