        <h2>What is mindfulness?</h2>
            <p>
                Mindfulness. It’s a pretty straightforward word. It suggests that the mind is fully attending to what’s happening, to what you’re doing, to the space you’re moving through. That might seem trivial, except for the annoying fact that we so often veer from the matter at hand. Our mind takes flight, we lose touch with our body, and pretty soon we’re engrossed in obsessive thoughts about something that just happened or fretting about the future. And that makes us anxious.

            <p>
                Yet no matter how far we drift away, mindfulness is right there to snap us back to where we are and what we’re doing and feeling. If you want to know what mindfulness is, it’s best to try it for a while. Since it’s hard to nail down in words, you will find slight variations in the meaning in books, websites, audio, and video.
            </p>
            <h2> The Definition of Mindfulness</h2>
            <p>
               Mindfulness is the basic human ability to be fully present, aware of where we are and what we’re doing, and not overly reactive or overwhelmed by what’s going on around us.
               Mindfulness is a quality that every human being already possesses, it’s not something you have to conjure up, you just have to learn how to access it.

        <h2> Benefits of mindfulness practice</h2>
            <p>
                When we meditate it doesn’t help to fixate on the benefits, but rather to just do the practice, and yet there are benefits or no one would do it.
                When we’re mindful, we reduce stress, enhance performance, and increase our attention to others’ well-being.
                Mindfulness meditation gives us a time in our lives when we can suspend judgment and unleash our natural curiosity about the workings of the mind, approaching our experience with warmth and kindness—to ourselves and others.

               <p>
                Mindfulness is not obscure or exotic. It’s familiar to us because it’s what we already do, how we already are. It takes many shapes and goes by many names.
               </p> 
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Mindfulness is not a special added thing we do. We already have the capacity to be present, and it doesn’t require us to change who we are. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    You don’t need to change. Solutions that ask us to change who we are or become something we’re not have failed us over and over again. Mindfulness recognizes and cultivates the best of who we are as human beings.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Anyone can do it. Mindfulness practice cultivates universal human qualities and does not require anyone to change their beliefs. Everyone can benefit and it’s easy to learn.

            <div>
                <p>
                    It’s a way of living.  Mindfulness is more than just a practice. It brings awareness and caring into everything we do—and it cuts down needless stress. Even a little makes our lives better.
                </p>

            <div>
                <p>
                    It’s evidence-based. We don’t have to take mindfulness on faith. Both science and experience demonstrate its positive benefits for our health, happiness, work, and relationships.
                </p>

                    It sparks innovation. As we deal with our world’s increasing complexity and uncertainty, mindfulness can lead us to effective, resilient, low-cost responses to seemingly intransigent problems.

        <h2>Mindfulness Is Not All in Your Head</h2>
        <div id="meditation">
        <div>
            <p>
                When we think about mindfulness and meditating (with a capital M), we can get hung up on thinking about our thoughts: we’re going to do something about what’s happening in our heads. It’s as if these bodies we have are just inconvenient sacks for our brains to lug around.
                Having it all remain in your head, though, lacks a feeling of good old gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                That approach can make it seem like floating—as though we don’t have to walk. We can just waft.
                But meditation begins and ends in the body. It involves taking the time to pay attention to where we are and what’s going on, and that starts with being aware of our body. That very act can be calming, since our body has internal rhythms that help it relax if we give it a chance.
